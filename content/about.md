Co-founder and smart contract developer at [Upstate Interactive](https://upstateinteractive.io), a software consultancy headquartered in Syracuse, NY.

I wrote my first line of HTML & CSS in 2015. Within the next two years I quit my job, started a company, packed my life in my car and moved across the country.

I'm passionate about blockchain technology and getting more women into tech. In Syracuse, I co-founded [Women in Coding](http://womenincoding.com) to provide education resources for women in the community. In 2018, I founded a group called [DAppLadies](https://www.dappladies.com) to teach female developers how to build decentralized applications. I'm also a co-founder of [The Rabbit Hole](https://www.rabbithole.network), a woman-powered blockchain community that promotes the participation and leadership of women in blockchain. 

Recently joined my first sorority & DAO, [Meta Gamma Delta](https://twitter.com/metagammadelta) ðŸ‘¹. 

What else can we decentralize? Let's have coffee and chat.
