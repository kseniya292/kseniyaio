### Intro to Solidity Part I & II

![image alt text](/images/IntroToSolidity.png)

In this Intro to Solidity workshop, I'll be starting with a basic overview of blockchain technology and and its history and progressing into teaching Solidity and how to write smart contracts. I'll go over developer tools and the basic components that make up a smart contract. Part II will expand upon these concepts and participants will be coding their very own smart contract.
