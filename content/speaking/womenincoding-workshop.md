### Intermediate HTML & CSS

This was a three hour workshop that built on top of the Introduction to HTML & CSS that Women in Coding was hosting. In this class, I taught students standard design practices like using a reset stylesheet, fixed navigation menus, hero images, web fonts, animations, and the basics of responsive design.
