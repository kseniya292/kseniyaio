I was reminiscing about my first website (the one that has been down for months). 

It was a Jekyll site, which was fun to build. 

I spent countless hours designing and redesigning it. Switching images, colors, fonts, header sizes. Should the headers be Sans or Sans-serif? Should I go for a minimalist look or use bright colors to make it standout? How many pictures of myself are too many pictures? I need to do a photoshoot. I need to design a logo. 

Finally, after a design was chosen...I hated it anyway. It seems that no matter what I design for myself, I won't like it. We are our own worst critics. 

This time, I decided to go with Hugo. Simply because we just rebuilt our company's website in Hugo. Check it out: <a href="https://www.upstateinteractive.io" target="_blank">www.upstateinteractive.io</a>. I also decided to pick a theme that doesn't require me to think to much about how to design it. The design is done. It's minimalist, and I dig it. 

Maybe one day when I'm famous and need a fancy website, I'll hire a designer to make me something beautiful. Until then, the coder theme will do. 


Cheers!
