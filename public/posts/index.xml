      <description>I was reminiscing about my first website (the one that has been down for months).
It was a Jekyll site, which was fun to build.
I spent countless hours designing and redesigning it. Switching images, colors, fonts, header sizes. Should the headers be Sans or Sans-serif? Should I go for a minimalist look or use bright colors to make it standout? How many pictures of myself are too many pictures? I need to do a photoshoot.</description>
